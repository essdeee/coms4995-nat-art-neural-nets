## Feedback

This is the first time this lab (and this course) has been offered, which means that all of these labs are new and will be tested for the first time in this section. This will be a learning experience for all involved, and we value any feedback as to how we can improve the lab, either for this semester or for future iterations. Please use the following form to send anonymized feedback to the TAs: [Anonymous Feedback Form](https://forms.gle/7cjMdyDBLFinLMEy5).
